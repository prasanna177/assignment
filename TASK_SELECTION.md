## Implementation Plan

### Approach
I focused exclusively on the Merchants Management features to deliver a complete, production-ready merchant management system. This strategic decision allowed me to implement all features with high quality, comprehensive error handling, and excellent UX rather than spreading effort across multiple incomplete features.

### Order of Implementation
1. **Merchant List View** - Established foundation with table display, search, sort, pagination, and API integration
2. **Add New Merchant** - Created form with validation, API integration, and success notifications
3. **Toast Notifications** - Implemented reusable toast component for user feedback
4. **Edit Merchant Details** - Added edit functionality with form pre-population and confirmation dialogs
5. **Merchant Details View** - Built comprehensive detail page with profile, statistics, transactions, and timeline
6. **Transaction Export** - Added CSV export functionality for transaction history

### Technical Decisions
- **React with TypeScript**: Strong typing for better code quality and developer experience
- **Client-side CSV Generation**: Used browser Blob API for CSV export without backend changes
- **Reusable Components**: Created Toast and ConfirmDialog components for consistent UX
- **Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling with API error message extraction
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts throughout
- **State Management**: Used React hooks (useState, useEffect) for local state management
- **API Integration**: Axios with interceptors for consistent request/response handling

### Assumptions
- Backend API endpoints return data in the specified format (RestResponse wrapper)
- Merchant ID is auto-generated by backend (not user input)
- Transaction data is available via existing GET /api/v1/transactions/{merchantId}/transactions endpoint
- CSV export is acceptable for transaction history (no PDF requirement)
- Authentication/authorization is handled separately (not part of this assessment)

### Timeline
- [x] Task selection: 11/23/2025 7:30
- [x] Start implementation: 11/23/2025 9:00
- [x] Target completion: 11/24/2025 15:58
